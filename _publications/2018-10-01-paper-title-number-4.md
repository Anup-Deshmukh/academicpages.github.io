**Summary of the work:**  Recent advancement of the Internet has generated large volume of high dimensional data. In many industrial applications, the size of datasets has exceeded the memory capacity provided by existing systems. Thus, the algorithms that can reduce data dimensions while preserving semantics are very much in need. One approach for doing this includes conserving the similarity between data objects. Hence, it is useful to develop methods that can generate a small size sketch of the given data objects while maintaining an estimate of the desired similarity between their corresponding sketches.

Proposed a dimensionality reduction sketching algorithm - simsketch - which maintains an estimate of the cosine similarity between original real valued vectors.

**Details will be available soon**
