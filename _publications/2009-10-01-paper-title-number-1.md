Inspired by an idea of [Filter Bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble) coined by [Eli Pariser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Pariser) and further brainstorming motivated me to work on a Recommender Systems. The movie buff inside me gave captivating possible work directions for introducing surprises while producing movie recommendations. I worked on a design of an approach that efficiently tackles the problem of high sparsity and overspecialization in
Collaborative filtering. Our goal was to effectuate serendipity in movie recommender systems with an end-to-end algorithm, Serendipitous Clustering for Collaborative Filtering (SC-CF) that considers diversity, unexpectedness and relevance.
