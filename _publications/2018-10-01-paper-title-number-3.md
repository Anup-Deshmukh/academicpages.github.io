The Spherical k-means is an important problem in unsupervised learning. It is similar to the k-means clustering problem and uses cosine similarity as a similarity/distance measure instead of euclidean distance. Although the SPKM Dhillon and Modha (2001) algorithm is simple and efficient, it depends on the initial values of the k cluster centers. The task of locating k initial cluster centers is important in obtaining high quality clustering. 

In this work we experimentally validated the SPKM++ algorithm by considering the spherical clustering problem
for large sparse document collections. We proved that, with our approach the computational complexity in SPKM++ can be decreased while retaining the clustering results.
