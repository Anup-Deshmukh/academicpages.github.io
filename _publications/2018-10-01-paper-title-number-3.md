**Abstract:** The Spherical k-means algorithm proposed by [Dhillon and Modha, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1007612920971) is a popular algorithm for clustering high dimensional datasets. Although their algorithm is simple and easy to implement, a drawback of the same is that it doesnâ€™t provide any provable guarantee on the clustering result. [Endo and Miyamoto, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23240-9_9) suggest an adaptive sampling based algorithm (Spherical k-means++) which gives near optimal results, with high probability. However, their algorithm requires k sequential passes over the entire dataset, which may not be feasible when the dataset and/or the values of k are large. 

In this work, we propose a Markov chain based sampling algorithm that takes only one pass over the data, and gives close to optimal clustering similar to Spherical k-means++, i.e., a faster algorithm while maintaining almost the same approximation. We present a theoretical analysis of the algorithm, and complement it with rigorous experiments on real-world datasets. We proved that, with our approach the computational complexity in SPKM++ can be decreased while retaining the clustering results. Our proposed algorithm is simple and easy to implement, and can be easily adopted in practice.
