title: "ContentNCF: Content Based Neural Collaborative Filtering -- UNiversity of Waterloo "
excerpt: "Some recent works have shown promising results in using deep learning, in particular convolutional neural networks (CNN), for collaborative filtering (CF).
These approaches employ deep neural networks to learn high order implicit cor-
relations between users and items. Up until now, deep learning based methods in collaborative filtering have focused on learning user-item interactions solely based on IDs as item representations. Modeling user-item interactions based on more extensive item features can provide more context with which we may recommend items to a user. By including content features, we can implicitly learn properties of items that similar users may prefer.<br/><img src='/images/put0.png' style="width: 50%; height: 50%">"

<p align="justify">In this work, we extend Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF), to content-based recommendation scenarios and present a CNN based collaborative filter-
ing approach tailored to image recommendation. We build upon the Pinterest
ICCV dataset used in [1] so as to include image features, and use it to make
content-based image recommendations. This content-based approach, Content-
NCF, proves successful in predicting user item interactions on our new Pinterest
Image 2019 dataset.</p>
