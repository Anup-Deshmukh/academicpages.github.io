title: "ContentNCF: Content Based Neural Collaborative Filtering -- University of Waterloo "
excerpt: "In this work, we extend Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF), to content-based recommendation scenarios and present a CNN based collaborative filter-
ing approach tailored to image recommendation. We build upon the Pinterest
ICCV dataset used in so as to include image features, and use it to make
content-based image recommendations. This content-based approach, Content-NCF, proves successful in predicting user item interactions on our new Pinterest
Image 2019 dataset.<br/><img src='/images/put0.png'>"
