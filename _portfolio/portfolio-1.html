title: "Emo-CNN for Perceiving Stress from Audio Signals: A Brain Chemistry Approach -- CentraleSupelec, France"
excerpt: "The emotion plays a key role in many applications like in healthcare domain to gather emotional behaviors. It is very crucial to determine “how it was said” other than “what it was said”. Therefore, in human- machine interaction applications, it is important that emotional states in human speech are fully perceived by Machine Learning model. Our ultimate goal at FAST lab was to model the stress from emotions. The abstract of this work is accepted in the International Conference on Speech Emotion Recognition and Affective Computing (ICSERAC) 2019. <br/><img src='/images/put3.png'>"
