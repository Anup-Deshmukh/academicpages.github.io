 <p align="justify"><dd> &#x21D2; The fun video which does the <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/neuraltalk2"><font color="1ad1ff">neaural talk</font></a> in real time motivated me to work on description generation models. I worked on a LSTM model to generate captions. The focus was on the inject architecture where the image features are directly incorporated into the LSTM during the sequence encoding process.</dd></p>
