title: "Detecting User Activities Using Cell Phone Accelerometers -- IIIT-B"
excerpt: "This project was part of the hackathon held at IIIT-B. One of the interesting problem we faced was to calculate the step count accurately. We used the FFT spectrograms and K-Means algorithm to calculate step counts and cluster different movements made respectively.<br/><img src='/images/put5.png'>"

 <p align="justify">The purpose of this project was to process data and classify behavior into four wide activity classes like running, climbing, cycling, sedentary and other using the predictive model. We were able to produce the clear and well separated clusters for activities using K-means Algorithm in Matlab. No libraries and packages were used in the implementation.</p>
