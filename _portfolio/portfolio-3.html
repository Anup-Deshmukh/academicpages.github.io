title: "Automated Essay Scoring with Cross Feature Vector Generation -- IIIT-B "
excerpt: "One of the difficulties of grading essays lies in the varying subjectivity of the grading process. This also leads to the contradicting variation in grades awarded by different human assessors, which is clearly unfair to the students. This problem
could be solved by the adoption of automated assessment tools for essays (text answers). We designed the model, Intelligent Text Rater (ITR) to automate the task of essay grading. We also implemented ITR with the proposed novel approach of feature vector generation of text essays and significantly reduced the required training data size.<br/><img src='/images/put2.png'>"
