title: "Description Generation from Images using Recurrent Neural Nets -- Multimodal Perception Lab, IIIT-B"
excerpt: "The fun video which does the <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/neuraltalk2"><font color="1ad1ff">neaural talk</font></a> in real time motivated me to work on description generation models. I worked on this interesting project where my goal was to generate captions from an image. The focus was on the inject architecture where the image features are directly incorporated into the LSTM during the sequence encoding process.<br/><img src='/images/put1.png'>"
