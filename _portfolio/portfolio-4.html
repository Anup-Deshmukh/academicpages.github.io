title: "Automatic Verification of Program Correctness -- IIIT-B"
excerpt: "The goal of this project is to develop a tool which identifies the correct submission. The tool will categorise the correct submissions into a set of distinct correct 'approaches' Compute the 'distance' of the submissions from all the correct submissions, and will apportion marks to submission based on its semantic distance. <br/><img src='/images/put4.png'>"

<p align="justify"> With the advent of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), it is becoming increasingly important to automate the correction of submitted answers. Verification of program correctness is cumbersome and costly because human testers will have to manually write test inputs and description of expected test results. Dynamic program analysis technique is based on the system execution. It enables us to detect dependencies that are not possible to detect otherwise in static analysis. We worked on Automatic Verification of Program Correctness using Dynamic Analysis. Our focus was on Ullmanâ€™s algorithm and Backtracking procedures which were used in converting one program dependence graph (PDG) to another in order to find the distances in submitted codes through Sketch tool. <a href="http://Anup-Deshmukh.github.io/files/06_13.pdf"><font color="1ad1ff">Document</font></a></p>
