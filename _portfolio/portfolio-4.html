title: "Spatio-Temporal Features of Crowd Models -- Murdoch University, Australia"
excerpt: "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN’s) have shown great performance in learning appearance representations from images. But learning of temporal features (Between multiple frames) and how they can be effectively used together with appearance features for video analysis, is a challenging problem. In the past few years, number of works on learning temporal features of crowd videos using CNN’s have been reported and during my internship we surveyed the state of the art techniques on this topic. For a brief time, I also worked under the assistance of Yasir Jan who extended the conditional GAN to crowd dataset like SHOCK and WIDER FACE to give the bounding boxes around the human entities in the general crowd images. <br/><img src='/images/put6.png'>"
