title: "Spatio-Temporal Features of Crowd Models -- Murdoch University, Australia"
excerpt: "The crowded scenes are increasing exponentially with the increase in the population. This is a big challenge in terms of public safety and security. It is not easy to handle the problem as more the number of individuals involved make the tracking and detection of anomaly in the crowds very difficult. Given above circumstances topics like understanding the Spatio-Temporal features and crowd counting has the important research direction. <br/><img src='/images/put6.png'>"

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN’s) have shown great performance in learning appearance representations from images. But learning of temporal features (Between multiple frames) and how they can be effectively used together with appearance features for video analysis, is a challenging problem. In the past few years, number of works on learning temporal features of crowd videos using CNN’s have been reported. With the knowledgeable dataset, CNN’s have great potential and during my internship we surveyed the state of the art techniques on this topic. For a brief time, I also worked under the assistance of Yasir Jan who extended the conditional GAN to crowd dataset like SHOCK and WIDER FACE to give the bounding boxes around the human entities in the general crowd images. </p>
