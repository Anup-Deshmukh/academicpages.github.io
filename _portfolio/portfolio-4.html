title: "Spatio-Temporal Features of Crowd Models -- Murdoch University"
excerpt: "The crowded scenes are increasing exponentially with the increase in the population. This is a big challenge in terms of public safety and security. It is not easy to handle the problem as more the number of individuals involved make the tracking and detection of anomaly in the crowds very difficult. Given above circumstances the topic of 'Crowd counting' is unique and has the important research direction. <br/><img src='/images/put6.png'>"

<p align="justify">During my internship, I worked on a problem of crowd counting which uses conditional GAN proposed by Philip Isola, UC
Berkley. The author has demonstrated that this approach can synthesize photos from label maps and colorizing images, among other tasks. I worked under the assistance of Yasir Jan who extended the conditional GAN to crowd dataset like SHOCK and WIDER FACE. The interesting approach exploits the image to image translation to give the bounding boxes around the human entities in the general crowd images. </p>
