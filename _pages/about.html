<div id="main1"><p align="justify"> <i>Hello! I'm Anup. I have joined <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/">David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science</a> at the  University of Waterloo from Fall 2019 where I am working under the supervision of <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~mli/">Prof. Ming Li</a> as a graduate student. I am also fortunate to work with <a href="https://lili-mou.github.io/">Prof. Lili Mou</a> affiliated with <a href="https://lili-mou.github.io/">AMII</a> and <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html">Department of Computing Science</a> at University of Alberta. 

  I completed my bachelors degree from <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/">IIIT-B</a> where I was affiliated to the <a href="http://mpl.iiitb.ac.in/">Multimodal Perception lab</a>, led by <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty_page.php?name=dineshbabujayagopi">Prof. Dinesh Babu</a> </i></p>


<p align="justify"><i>I enjoy working on Deep learning methods that are especially applied to <b>Recommender Systems</b> and <b>Natural Language Processing</b>. You can find details of my <a href="https://anup-deshmukh.github.io/anup-publications/">Publications</a> and <a href="https://anup-deshmukh.github.io/anup-iiitb-projects/">Projects</a> here.</i></b></p>

<p align="justify"> I am currently working on unsupervised methods for parsing human languages. Without using the human-labeled constituency trees or other syntactic labeling, we can force our model to learn the dependanices in a natural way and possibly mimic the way humans learn the language.</p>  

Within Recommender Systems (RS) my research focuses on building efficient and scalable Machine Learning algorithms which go <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system#Beyond_accuracy">beyond accuracy</a>. During my thesis at IIIT-B, broadly, my goal was to exploit Deep Learning methods to learn user-item interaction function in RS. </p> 



"I successfully defended my Masters thesis at IIIT-B", "I gave my first TEDx pre-event talk titled \"Burst your Filter Bubble\""]'

<p align="justify"> Apart from my work, I enjoy <a href="https://anup-deshmukh.github.io/talkmap.html">travelling</a> and hiking. I am also an avid reader of world politics and get considerable enjoyment from sports.
