> The real danger is not that computers will begin to think like men, but that men will begin to think like computers ~ Sydney H.

Hello! I'm Anup, observant, maverick and a believer of [optimistic nihilism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBRqu0YOH14). I currently reside in Bangalore where I'm majoring in computer science engineering at [IIIT-B](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/) (final year). 

My first internship at [Slicepay](https://slicepay.in/) gave me an opportunity to work as a Full stack developer. My work at Murdoch university in the summer of 2017 introduced me to the world of deep learning and ground breaking capability of Convolutional Neural Networks. Under the supervision of [Prof Ferdous Sohel](http://profiles.murdoch.edu.au/myprofile/ferdous-sohel/), I worked on the problem of crowd counting and learning of spatio-temporal features for crowd models. I have also enjoyed working with awesome researchers and engineers in industry, mainly an internship at [FAST lab](http://www.rennes.supelec.fr/ren/rd/fast/team.php) in the summer of 2018 ([details will be added here](https://anup-deshmukh.github.io/publications/)).
     
## My Interests

I enjoy working on computer vision and deep learning methods; and my research interests include related fields such as human-computer interaction, Recommender Systems and generative models in deep learning. 

I am very interested in studying the adversarial attacks on deep learning models. A deluge of recent papers have proposed methods for defenses. The problem is surprisingly complex and it is not difficult at all to create new adversarial images  to circumvent existing solutions. This study of making neural networks robust to these attacks interests me. 

> Creativity is part of human nature. It can be only be untaught. ~ Ai Weiwei.

I am curious about the methods for AI models to understand the creativity in their tasks and think that generative models like GANâ€™s have great potential. Here, being creative although is very subjective, roughly means to be original and not just try to be less of a copycat than before (term borrowed from my friend). The existing work revolving around the same have identified the problem well but more has to be done in a different direction rather than making the optimization sophisticated by putting more and more constraints. 

In a nutshell, here is the inclusive but not an exhaustive list of works that has amused me recently:
