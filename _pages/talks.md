<p align="justify">Motivated by my interest in the applied sciences and problem-solving, I took the Joint Entrance Examination. I was able to secure admission into the International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) Bangalore,
which has one of the finest Information Technology Department in this part of the world. </p>

<p align="justify"> I am currently in the fourth year of the Integrated Masters program at IIIT-B. This small and beautiful campus perfectly satisfied my all academic and non-academic needs. I met many interesting people, friends and seniors with whom I have had good learning experiance. To my knowledge, IIIT-B is one of the best in terms of their academic curriculum including several electives offered. This gave me an opportunity to explore and truly understand what my interests are. Courses like Data Structures and Algorithms, Linear Algebra, Signal Processing, Automata Theory, Big Data Algorithms, Machine Learning and Advanced Cryptography have helped me gain considerable exposure to the wide spectrum of fields in Computer Science engineering.</p>

Below is the list of projects I worked on in my academic life at IIIT-B

* **Description Generation from Images using Recurrent Neural Nets**
  * <p align="justify">The fun video which does the <q>neaural talk</q> in real time motivated me to work on description generation models. I worked on a LSTM model to generate captions. The inject architecture where the image features are directly incorporated into the LSTM during the sequence encoding process was used.</p>

* **Automated Essay Scoring with Cross Feature Vector Generation** 
  * <p align="justify">There exists [state of art techniques](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/E09-1065) which simply check for complete correctness of submitted text answers against a set of test cases. It is equally important to find the distance of how far are these submitted text answers from the golden standard. 
  * <p align="justify">We designed the model, Intelligent Text Rater (ITR) to automate the task of essay grading. We also implemented ITR with the proposed novel approach of feature vector generation of text essays and significantly reduced the required training data size.

* **Automatic Verification of Program Correctness**
  * <p align="justify">With the advent of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), it is becoming increasingly important to automate the correction of submitted answers. Verification of program correctness is cumbersome and costly because human testers will have to manually write test inputs and description of expected test results. Dynamic program analysis technique is based on the system execution. It enables us to detect dependencies that are not possible to detect otherwise in static analysis. 
   * <p align="justify">We worked on Automatic Verification of Program Correctness using Dynamic Analysis. Our focus was on Ullmanâ€™s algorithm and Backtracking procedures which were used in converting one program dependence graph (PDG) to another in order to find the distances in submitted codes through Sketch tool.

* **Detecting User Activities Using Cell Phone Accelerometers**
  * <p align="justify">The purpose of this project was to process data and classify behavior into four wide activity classes like running, climbing, cycling, sedentary and other using the predictive model. We were able to produce the clear and well separated clusters for activities using K-means Algorithm in Matlab. No libraries and packages were used in the implementation.
