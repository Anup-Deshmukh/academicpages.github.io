Motivated by my interest in the applied sciences and problem-solving, I took the Joint Entrance Examination. I was able to secure admission into the International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) Bangalore, which has one of the finest Information Technology Department in this part of the world.

I am currently in the fourth year of the Integrated Masters program at IIIT-B. This small and beautiful campus perfectly satisfied my all academic and non-academic needs. I met many interesting people, friends and seniors with whom I have had good learning experiance. To my knowledge, IIIT-B is one of the best in terms of their academic curriculum including several electives offered. This gave me an opportunity to explore and truly understand what my interests are. Courses like Data Structures and Algorithms, Linear Algebra, Signal Processing, Automata Theory, Big Data Algorithms, Machine Learning and Advanced Cryptography have helped me gain considerable exposure to the wide spectrum of fields in Computer Science engineering.

Below is the list of projects I worked on in my academic life at IIIT-B
